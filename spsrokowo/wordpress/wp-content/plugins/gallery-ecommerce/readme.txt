How to create a new pricelist

Pricelists are grouped price options for items. Any pricelist can include its own title, tax rate, prices, description, shipping rate and parameters, as well as details for digital images with image size, price, dimension and etc. By creating each pricelist you can apply it to single or multiple items. 
In Pricelists option of Gallery Ecommerce you will be able to check options for printed products and digital images. Prints and products are actual products displayed with an image, downloads are sets of images (different dimensions of the same image) for free or paid download.

Prints and products

Name and describe the product(s) that is included in this price list. Let's say the title of the pricelist is Frames and in this pricelist you set the price(s) for wooden frames. You will want to name this field "Wooden frames".Set price and shipping rate. For shipping you can either set a fixed shipping rate or a percentage-based cost. Shipping calculation will be  based on grouped products and not individual one.
You can add specific parameters to your product including. inputs, textarea, select, radio and checkbox. This especially is helpful when you set different parameters, for example prices,  for the same category products. In case of "Wooden frames", the brown frame can have one price, whereas the black one can include another price option. Based on parameter the prices of the products/prints might vary. Please fill in the difference using the table, e.g. if color is black + 2= when black item is selected the price will be $2 more expensive than the brown price or if you have red-2= when red item is selected the price will be $2 cheaper than brown option.
After filling out options press Save/Apply button.

Downloads (digital content)

For digital download you can have license pages for terms of download and image license. Tick the checkbox and select the page which will be used for this purpose.
Name the item, set the price and set the longest dimension of the item. Each image might have different dimensions for download. For adding more dimensions for the image use Add item button.Set the size and price for each option.
Note: The pricelist can include different dimensions but only dimensions smaller that the original image will be applied to it, e.g. 800x600, 600x450, 450x300, but if the image is only 660x500, only last two options will be applied to the image if the pricelist is added to this specific image.
